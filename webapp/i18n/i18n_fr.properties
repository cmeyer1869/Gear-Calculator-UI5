helpText=The gear calculator displays graphically the speed and development (either in gear inches or in meters) for all gears of a given gearing system, either with derailleurs or with hub gears. \n Gearing system, chainrings and cogs can be chosen out of given lists or selected by moving the sprocket symbols. Not used chainwheels and cogs can be removed by moving them to the left below the graphics. \n The tire size can be chosen out of a list or the tire circumference can be entered in millimeters. \n \n The gear calculator doesn't know your riding performance, of course. Therefore it is best to start with the gearing data of one of your bikes, which gearing you know or from which you know if you miss some gears at specific speeds. The gear calculator starts with a typical mountain bike 2x10 setup. The compare option allows to find a better gearing for your riding style. \n It is also possible to compare two bikes with different tire sizes.\n the max allowed chain angle defines which gears should be avoided.\n The link at the bottom opens the gear calculator with the currently selected setup which is useful for online discussions if you want to illustrate a specific gearing option.
